However, a similar approach can be taken to also consider these risks and the appropriate design of these payments."

    "section": "4.1 Insurance or a flat payment",
    "text": "4.1 Insurance or a flat payment\nThe Australian social security system was based on a similar principle to systems implements in the United Kingdom and New Zealand at the same time. Following the Beveridge Report’s indication for the need for social insurance to prevent hardship and encourage participation following World War II, Australia introduced the Social Security Act.\nThis act established a flat rate and non-contributory payment, with the rate paid varying due to the nature of the hardship experienced. This also took responsibility for such schemes largely away from individual States and thereby standardised treatment across Australia.\nThe element of unemployment benefits that reflects a flat rate, non-contributory, payment is typically called unemployment assistance (UA) (OECD 2024). XXX\nAlthough this sounds similar to a universal basic income (UBI) there are key distinctions:\n\nA UBI is paid to every individual, while UA is contingent on family structure and income.\nA UBI is not directly abated at an individuals income increases - as a result for the same tax scale effective marginal tax rates are much lower for UBI recipients.\nCommonly, a UBI does not involve mutual obligations or a specific requirement for job search while UA generally does.\n\nAnother element of any social support system is unemployment insurance (UI). The insurance element of a social support system differs from the assistance element in terms of the payment (typically linked to income prior to the event) and the funding mechanism (typically involves a contribution from the individual prior to the event which determines their eligibility).\n\n\n\nExample Table Using R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nUnemployment.Assistance\nUniveral.Basic.Income\nUnemployment.Insurance\n\n\n\n\nPayment relative to income\nFlat Rate\nFlat Rate\nRelative to prio Income\n\n\nEmployee contributions\nNone\nNone\nLevy\n\n\nIndividual Means testing\nValue 8\nValue 9\nValue 9\n\n\nFamily based Means testing\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nJob Search obligations\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nTime limitations\nLimited\nNone\nBetween X and X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Broad rationale for distinction in payments\nThe reason why such policies are considered as distinct, even though they form part of the same social safety net, is that the policy objectives of each part of the system differ. A UA/UBI payment reflects a minimum income standard related to views around poverty. A UI system reflects an insurance motive where individuals can pool ex-ante risk relating to a shock.\nIn terms of the minimum income standard this reflects in the necessary income that is required to meet this standard. The nature of the life event (i.e. disability, temporary illness, redundancy, or voluntary unemployment) and the structure of the family\nIn terms of insurance this reflects in XXX\nIn this note we are focused solely on job loss risk. Such an event is deemed to be temporary and therefore XXX\n\n\n4.1.2 The income unit\nThe income unit reflects a set of individuals who share resources, and so may be able to consume more than sum of their private incomes would suggest. The primary sharing that is often considered is intra-household sharing, or what is termed economies of scale in the household."
