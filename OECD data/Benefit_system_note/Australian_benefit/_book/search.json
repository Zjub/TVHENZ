    "section": "5.1 Insurance or a flat payment",
    "text": "5.1 Insurance or a flat payment\nThe Australian social security system was based on a similar principle to systems implemented in the United Kingdom and New Zealand through the 1930s and 1940s. Following the 1942 Beveridge Report’s recommendation of a cradle to the grave social insurance to prevent hardship and encourage participation following World War II, Australia introduced the Social Security Act 1947.\nThe policy changes post-WWII were much broader than just transfer payments - with a series of other changes related to healthcare, education, and labour market regulation. Australia and New Zealand’s Social Security Act’s and following transfer system designed were predicated on the unique choices they made with regards to these broader policy settings (castles1994?).\nThe Social Security act established a flat rate and non-contributory payment, with the rate paid varying due to the nature of the hardship experienced. This also took responsibility for such schemes largely away from individual States and thereby standardised treatment across Australia.\nThe element of unemployment benefits that reflects a flat rate, non-contributory, payment is typically called unemployment assistance (UA) [OECD (2024a)](OECD 2024b). XXX\nAlthough this sounds similar to a universal basic income (UBI) there are key distinctions:\n\nA UBI is paid to every individual, while UA is contingent on family structure and income.\nA UBI is not directly abated at an individuals income increases - as a result for the same tax scale effective marginal tax rates are much lower for UBI recipients.\nCommonly, a UBI does not involve mutual obligations or a specific requirement for job search while UA generally does.\n\nAnother element of any social support system is unemployment insurance (UI). The insurance element of a social support system differs from the assistance element in terms of the payment (typically linked to income prior to the event) and the funding mechanism (typically involves a contribution from the individual prior to the event which determines their eligibility).\n\n\n\nExample Table Using R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nUnemployment.Assistance\nUniveral.Basic.Income\nUnemployment.Insurance\n\n\n\n\nPayment relative to income\nFlat Rate\nFlat Rate\nRelative to prior Income\n\n\nEmployee contributions\nIncome Tax\nIncome Tax\nLevy\n\n\nIndividual Means testing\nValue 8\nValue 9\nValue 9\n\n\nFamily based Means testing\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nJob Search obligations\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nTime limitations\nLimited\nNone\nBetween X and X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Broad rationale for distinction in payments\nThe reason why such policies are considered as distinct, even though they form part of the same social safety net, is that the policy objectives of each part of the system differ. A UA/UBI payment reflects a minimum income standard related to views around poverty. A UI system reflects an insurance motive where individuals can pool ex-ante risk relating to a shock.\nIn terms of the minimum income standard this reflects in the necessary income that is required to meet this standard. The nature of the life event (i.e. disability, temporary illness, redundancy, or voluntary unemployment) and the structure of the family\nIn terms of insurance this reflects in a tool where individuals contribute to a scheme that will compensate them if some ex-ante risk is realised. This combines a shifting of income through time and pooling of risk among individuals.\nIn this note we are focused solely on job loss risk. Such an event is deemed to be temporary and therefore XXX\n\n\n5.1.2 The income and the income unit\nThe definition of income and how it can be measured and considered is outlined in (United Nations 2011). The relevant income measure reflects individual well-being through their “ability to acquire the goods and services they need to satisfy their needs”.\nIn this way, the definition of income used to assess eligibility distinguishes itself from a purely flow income concept (i.e. Haig-Simons income - of the concept of potential income without lowering a stock of assets (simons1938?) (haig1921?), as the stock of assets an individual has allows them to satisfy these needs.\nThe income unit reflects a set of individuals who share resources, and so may be able to consume more than sum of their private incomes would suggest. The primary sharing that is often considered is intra-household sharing, or what is termed economies of scale in the household.\nXXX\nThe personal income tax system alone reflects a view of the ability to pay out of flow income at the individual level. It is the application of the benefit system that then reflects a broader view regarding peoples ability to meet a minimum standard.\nWithin this context, social policy settings that are focused on this minimum standard will apply rules about assets and family structure which reflect these views - and create a distinction between how a dollar of market income is treated as opposed to a dollar of transfer income:\n[table comparing tax and benefit treatment]",

    "text": "5.2 Rationale for varying systems\nAbove we noted that the distinguishing policy rationale for the unemployment assistance (UA) attribute of a support system and the unemployment insurance (UI) attribute was a minimum income standard as opposed to lifetime income insurance. In this section we will be a bit more specific with this distinction.\n\n\n\nExample Table Using R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy.Aim\nUnemployment.Assistance\nUniveral.Basic.Income\nUnemployment.Insurance\n\n\n\n\nWelfare-to-work\nFlat Rate\nFlat Rate\nRelative to prior Income\n\n\nIncome Adequacy\nNone\nNone\nLevy\n\n\nFiscal Cost\nValue 8\nValue 9\nValue 9\n\n\nXXX\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nXXX\nValue 8\nValue 8\nValue 8\n\n\nXXX\nLimited\nNone\nBetween X and X\n\n\n\n\n\nA UA system can be seen as a Robin Hood type redistributive tool to alleviate poverty. Such a scheme can thereby be evaluated through its effectiveness at reducing poverty rates. As it is redistributive there is a long history of debating the conditionality of such support - both in terms of varying payments and eligibility criteria for reasons associated with not working, means testing of receipt, and mutual obligations required to continue receipt of payments. These reflect a determination of who society wishes to give the transfer too, and what obligations individuals have to meet to continue receiving it. The key distinction of a UBI is therefore the removal of such conditionality.\nA UI system on the other hand aims to satisfy a Piggy Bank function - helping individuals shift resources through time and across states of the world (Barr2001?). This function XXX\nThis description of a UI system hides two significantly different smoothing functions - self-insurance and social insurance.\nA traditional UI system is an example of a social insurance vehicle. All labour income earners contribute to a mandatory insurance scheme (to mitigate adverse selection), and then if the individual ex-post experiences job loss they can claim from this scheme on the basis of their prior earnings. Such a scheme has the advantage of allowing the efficient ex-ante pooling of job loss risk but suffers from moral hazard concerns if individuals remain on the benefit for longer, or orchestrate an exit from a job, solely to claim the payment.\nAn alternative to this that would not suffer from the same concerns around moral hazard is a self-insurance or savings scheme. In a similar vein to compulsory superannuation, if individuals are undersaving for job loss risk for personal reasons (i.e. excessive discounting, wrong expectations about job loss risk) a compulsory savings vehicle forces the individual to insure themselves against this risk. However, without the benefit of risk pooling such schemes would end up providing weaker insurance for those who realise a job loss and excessive savings for those who do not.\nIn Australia, there is no clear UI element to the income support system. As a result, if market failures were pervasive in the market for job loss insurance then the introduction of such a policy could help to solve this. This could allow for more efficient levels of personal savings, better job matching, and lower welfare costs associated with job loss. However, this has to be seen in conjunction with the large compulsory retirement savings program - which is already forcing individuals to self-insure against the final job ending event in retirement.\n\n5.2.1 Rational for varying payment systems and rates\nThere are three key factors behind the determination of payment rates:\n\nThe length of eligibility and receipt,\nThe generosity of the payment - both relative to prior income and relative to average earnings,\nMeans testing and the form of income a payment is abated against.\n\nXXX\n\n\n5.2.2 Rational for varying revenue raising systems\nA key distinction between the funding of an UA and a UI system comes from the decision to fund it from general tax revenue, or to apply a hypothecated revenue raising device (such as a levy).\nThe Australian tax system is predicated on a broad-based low rate system. As a result, spending initiatives are generally separated from revenue raising initatives - with the idea that revenue should be raised in the most efficient way possible to meet government expenditure goals.\nA levy differs from funding from general taxation in three key ways:\n\nA levy funds UI directly from labour income, lowering the tax burden on capital - but also generating the incentive to redefine labour income to capital income (i.e. self-employment income).\nA levy makes the scheme more salient by associating the payment with an expected benefit - thereby reducing distortions to labour supply.\nPre-funding of a levy can be used to build up a social asset to fund a UI scheme, shifting the revenue risk clearly off the government budget.\n\n(including OECD levy rates)\n\n\n\n\nOECD. 2024a. “Income Support, Redistribution, and Work Incentives.” https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/income-support-redistribution-and-work-incentives.html.\n\n\n———. 2024b. “The OECD Tax-Benefit Database: Description of policy rules of Australia.” https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-sub-issues/incomes-support-redistribution-and-work-incentives/TaxBEN-Australia-latest.pdf.\n\n\nUnited Nations. 2011. “Canberra Group Handbook on Household Income Statistics: Second Edition.” https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/groups/cgh/Canbera_Handbook_2011_WEB.pdf.",
