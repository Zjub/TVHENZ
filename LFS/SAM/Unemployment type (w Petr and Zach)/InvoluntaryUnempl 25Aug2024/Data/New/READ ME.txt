STOCK_BY_AGE_CLEARED- 

This further breaks down the EU variable into EU_inv- As above but using the range              1110 <=REASLLJ<=1231
EU_j2j- if they indicate that they left last employer because they were unsatisfied with work conditions and pay. 2014 or 2016
and EU_vol- they left for some other voluntary reason. We use the range 2017<=REASLLJ<=2021
EMP UNEMP and NILF variables are weighted stocks.

This file also breaks down by age.


STOCK_FLOW_BY_TYPE_v2.csv

This is as above., However, we also don't aggregate by age in this one. 

STOCK_FLOW_BY_TYPE.csv
- This is sort of the aggregation of the so called "strict" and loose definitions of unemployment. In the sense that instead of having a separate J2J series  I aggregated the J2J reasons and the broad voluntary. 
For more information I have included a key of the reasons that are in the data and the range above.
